#Text Formatter

*This code takes an input file, adds formatting, and places it into an output file.

Make sure input text file has no newlines at the end of the file. If there are empty newlines present the script will throw out an error, but functionality remains!

For the output file, I like to create an empty text file and use that files pathway.
